## CoronaVirusTracker
Java Spring Boot application to track reported data of confirmed Coronavirus infections COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) around the world.

This is a development grade project with some not so good solutuions for the production but fair enough for my current practicing purposes.


BackEnd created with <b>Java Spring Boot</b> with the local class as a storage of data fetched from external source.</br>
External source is a scv file stored [over here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=cnLkiEkRUXzify5cQI1YjcB3-hx8MTU4NDcyMjExMUAxNTg0NjM1NzEx&event=video_description&v=8hjNG9GZGnQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCSSEGISandData%2FCOVID-19)

Frontend made with <b>Thymeleaf</b>.
